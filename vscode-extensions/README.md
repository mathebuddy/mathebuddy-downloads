# Visual Studio Code Plugins

We provide VSCode plugins to develop and test courses for the app offline.

_REMARK: we will publish the extensions to VSCode Marketplace later._

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code

Download **Visual Studio Code**: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Plugins

Download the latest plugins for Mathebuddy from GitHub: [Link](https://github.com/mathebuddy/mathebuddy-downloads/tree/main/vscode-plugins)

There are two plugins:

- `mathe-buddy-lang-VERSION.vsix` provides language support (syntax and semantical highlighting).
- `mathe-buddy-sim-VERSION.vsix` provides a simulator to test sources in VSCode.

Download the latest release (highest version number) of each plugin.

Open VSCode, go to the extensions panel (left menu), click on the three-dots `...` and select `Install from VSIX`. Then choose each of the downloaded plugins and install it.
